Are you a member of Radio Amateur Canada (RAC)?

If so, make sure to check out the September-October edition of *The Canadian Amateur (TCA)*, for two informative articles on amateur radio in space. 

Keith Baker (VA3KSF/KB1SF) provides an update on a possible new GEOsat for North America, as well as information on how to get started with "amsats."

And don't miss an update from Matthew Borghese (VA7USD) who shares the latest on amateur radio equipment that recently flew up to the International Space Station, and how you can get involved with AMSAT-CA!
