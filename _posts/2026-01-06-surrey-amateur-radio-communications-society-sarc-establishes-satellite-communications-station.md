The Surrey Amateur Radio Communications Society (SARC) in British Columbia has established a fully operational satellite communications station, expanding our club’s capabilities into space-based amateur radio, which could be critical in emergencies. Led by Dino Gueorguiev VE7NX and John Brodie VA7XB, and supported by the SARC Projects Group, this station provides a robust platform for making reliable satellite contacts and mentoring members in advanced satellite radio operating techniques.

While individual members have previously operated satellites from home or portable setups, the new station represents a significant upgrade in capability, providing the club with a dedicated, permanent installation designed for optimal performance.

At the heart of the station is an Icom IC-9700 transceiver, enhanced with a frequency stabilization module to ensure accuracy during satellite passes. A thorough review of station requirements was conducted, and equipment was selected to balance performance, cost, and future scalability.

**Station Equipment**

* Yaesu G-5500DC Azimuth/Elevation rotator and control system
* Yaesu thrust bearing for mechanical support
* FoxDelta ST2 USB tracking interface
* Diamond A144S5 2m 5-element Yagi antenna
* Diamond A430S10 440 MHz 10-element Yagi antenna
* 120 feet of LMR-400 Ultraflex coaxial cable
* Mini PC running SatPC32 satellite tracking software (AMSAT)

The antenna support structure, designed and fabricated by John (VA7XB), utilizes 1.5” angle aluminum for strength and precision alignment. The completed assembly was installed on the flat roof of SARC's Operations Centre, with all cabling integrated into the existing infrastructure. Provisions have been made for future expansion to 1.2 GHz capability.

**Technical Approach**

SARC's design emphasizes performance and efficiency. Rather than using cross-polarized Yagis, they employ high-gain linear-polarized antennas. The theoretical 3 dB loss from polarization mismatch is easily mitigated by the IC-9700’s built-in preamp, avoiding the additional complexity and cost of polarization switching systems. This pragmatic approach delivers excellent results for their operational needs.

The station’s tracking and frequency control is fully automated. SatPC32 software manages real-time antenna positioning via the FoxDelta tracker, providing 450° azimuth and 180° elevation movement, while simultaneously adjusting transmit and receive frequencies to compensate for Doppler shift.

**Operational Success**

The station was brought online within six weeks from project inception to first contact. Following system integration and testing, the team established successful communications through a variety of satellites, including the TEVEL CubeSats, linear transponder satellites, and the International Space Station (ISS).

The TEVEL mission, a series of educational CubeSats developed by the Herzliya Science Center in Israel, provides FM amateur radio transponders and represents an exciting contact opportunity. The station's performance on these passes confirmed the effectiveness of our system design and operational procedures.

**Looking Ahead**

SARC’s satellite station enhances our club’s technical profile and offers members a hands-on opportunity to engage with advanced communication modes. With a solid foundation now in place, future upgrades will be considered as needs evolve and interest grows. The satellite station will play an integral role in upcoming club activities, including Field Day operations, public demonstrations, and ongoing member training.

We invite all SARC members (and non-members) to participate in this exciting facet of amateur radio, leveraging our expertise, infrastructure, and collaborative spirit.
