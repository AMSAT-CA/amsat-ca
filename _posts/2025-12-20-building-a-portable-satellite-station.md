## Building a Portable Satellite Station?

Many satellite enthusiasts successfully use the IC-9700 portably: powering it from a battery, connecting a laptop for optional tracking and Doppler correction. The radio's real-time spectrum scope and waterfall display help you spot your own signal on linear transponders or monitor activity across the passband.

The IC-9700 is the radio I use for communicating to other amateurs through satellites in the field.

**IC-9700 for portable operating**

* Tri-band all-mode transceiver -- covering 2 meters, 70 cm, and 23 cm
* Full-duplex operation — Hear your downlink while transmitting on the uplink.
* Built-in Satellite mode with up to 99 memories — Easily store uplink/downlink frequencies, modes, and offsets.
* Reverse/Normal tracking and AFC (Automatic Frequency Control) to manage Doppler shift.
* High-quality SDR-based reception with spectrum scope and waterfall for visualizing the transponder passband
* Separate antenna ports for each band — No external duplexer required for basic 2m/70cm satellite work.

Additional accessories for operating portable

* Power Source — A 12V battery system (I use my truck battery) as well I use two small 12V rechargeable battery packs to operate the rotors and antenna components, and a 5V to operate the S.A.T. box.
* Antenna — I use the lightweight dual-band Yagi Arrow II (2m/70cm). Being lightweight, my rotors on the small tripod can easily follow the satellites through an entire pass.
* Tracking — I use the CSN Technologies S.A.T. controller and through an IP address I connect to the controller to select the satellite to operate. The S.A.T. then takes over to direct the rotors and set the frequencies, including the doppler, of the radio. I can download all the satellite data to the S.A.T. box before heading out to site or I can use cell service, if available, to get the information on site.
* Accessories — Low-loss coax (e.g., LMR-400), tripod/mount, headphones, and a comfortable mic or headset.
