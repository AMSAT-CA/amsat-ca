    heading: Who We Are
    text: >
      AMSAT-CA was founded by Stefan Wagner VE4SW and others from across Canada
      and incorporated as a non-profit in November 2023.


      In May 2024, AMSAT-CA was recognized by Radio Amateur Canada (RAC) as the official amateur radio satellite organization for Canada.


      Later that year, AMSAT-CA also received recognition from AMSAT-US and the organization began to take further shape.


      AMSAT-CA operates as a member-driven, outreach-focused organization that works in collaboration with partners across the world.
