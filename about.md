    heading: Who We Are
    text: >
      AMSAT-CA was founded by Stefan Wagner VE4SW and others from across Canada
      and incorporated as a non-profit in November 2023.


      In May 2024, AMSAT-CA was recognized by Radio Amateur Canada (RAC) as the official amateur radio satellite organization for Canada.


      Later that year, AMSAT-CA also received recognition from AMSAT-US and the organization began to take further shape.


      AMSAT-CA operates as a member-driven, outreach-focused organization that works in collaboration with partners across the world.

    heading: Our Mission
    text: >-
      AMSAT-CA promotes, develops, and supports Amateur Radio in space,
      including via human-made and natural satellites (e.g., the Moon), space
      stations and planets, and related experiments, as well as new developments
      in technology, methods and techniques.


      We strive to bring those together who have interests related to this mission, and create an inclusive community where folks from across Canada who are motivated by common goals can meet, collaborate and exchange ideas. We also serve as a resource for those who are new to the world of Amateur Radio and satellites, connecting them with experienced individuals, and helping them get started.

      AMSAT-CA is committed to the protection of Amateur satellite spectrum from
      encroachment of commercial interests and pollution by human-made
      interference. We are happy to assist members with guidance and advocacy in
      this regard; please email us at
      [regulatory@amsat-ca.org](regulatory@amsat-ca.org) with questions and
      concerns.


      For university-based satellite teams looking for endorsement by us for IARU frequency coordination, please note that at the moment is done by the Radio Amateurs of Canada (RAC) Satellite Committee only. You can reach them at [satellites@rac.ca](satellites@rac.ca). Noting their endorsement only on the forms will not harm of a Canadian mission's chances for receiving IARU endorsement.
